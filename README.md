# Fraud-Analysis
The Fraud Analysis Dashboard for Nigeria reveals critical insights into fraudulent activities by region, device type, and month. Key findings show that the Suwami region has the highest outstanding loan balance, indicating significant financial exposure. The Tecno Ck6 phone model is most commonly associated with fraud, suggesting potential targeting or vulnerability. Fraud peaks in February, signaling a need for heightened monitoring and preventative measures during this period. Additionally, a considerable number of cases remain uninvestigated, pointing to a resource gap in fraud investigation. These insights enable stakeholders to allocate resources strategically, target high-risk areas, and address seasonal fraud trends effectively.

## Overview
**Purpose**: The dashboard is designed to analyze fraudulent activity across different regions, phone models, and time periods in Nigeria.
**Objective**: To provide insights into fraud patterns for improved risk management, focusing on regions, devices, loan balances, and monthly trends.

## Data Sources
Description of data sources used (e.g., transaction logs, customer data, regional information).
Frequency of data updates (e.g., monthly).
Data cleaning and preprocessing methods are used to ensure accuracy.

## Key Metrics and Visual Elements
**Outstanding Loan Balance**: Displays the total loan balance associated with each region, with the highest in Suwami.
**Most Affected Phone Model**: Highlights "Tecno Ck6" as the most common model associated with fraudulent activity.
**Most Affected Month**: February shows the highest fraud activity, helping to focus preventive measures.
**Highly Affected by Fraud (Region)**: A bar chart depicting the percentage of cases marked as confirmed fraud, confirmed not fraud, and not investigated across regions.
**Most Affected Phone Model & Region**: A count of fraud cases segmented by phone model and region.
**Fraud Months**: Monthly breakdown of fraud incidents to show peak periods.

## Insights and Findings
**High Loan Balances in Fraudulent Regions**: Regions like Suwami and Bumasi have the highest outstanding loan balances, which could indicate higher fraud risk due to potentially larger financial exposure.
**Device-Specific Fraud**: The Tecno Ck6 is disproportionately involved in fraud cases, suggesting either a vulnerability or targeting of this specific model.
**Seasonal Fraud Patterns**: Fraud activity peaks in February, implying that additional measures should be implemented in or before this month.
**Investigative Gaps**: A large proportion of cases remain uninvestigated, indicating potential resource constraints in fraud investigation.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders
**Targeted Fraud Prevention in High-Risk Regions**: Focus fraud prevention resources in Suwami and Bumasi, where outstanding loan balances and fraud incidences are highest.
**Device-Specific Security Measures**: Collaborate with device manufacturers or telecom providers to implement additional security protocols on vulnerable models like Tecno Ck6.
**Seasonal Preparedness**: Prepare for heightened fraud activity in February by increasing monitoring and fraud detection capabilities leading up to this period.
**Resource Allocation for Investigations**: Address the backlog of uninvestigated cases by allocating additional resources to fraud investigation teams.
